# gis_maps
Collection of a few maps I made through out my GIS courses. 

Descriptions:

drone_lab: Made in GIS 2. For this lab I collected drone imagery -- I chose a salt marsh near our school. The imagery was then  loaded and processed using Metashape and analyzed variation in elevation using the profile tool. 

gisII_poster: This poster was my partner and I's final project for GIS 2. We used the Arc GIS Empirical Bayesian Kriging Tool to interpolate ice thickness in the Canadian Artic. 

gnsslab: Made in GIS 2. For this lab we used Emlid GNSS units to practice logging high accuracy data. My group did four surveys: static PPP, kinematic PPP, PPK and RTK. We set up our own base stationa and processed our data using Emlid Studio and the Canadian Spatial Reference System PPP online application. 

lab1: Made in GIS 2. The purpose of this lab was to learn how to georectify aerial imagery using the QGIS georeferencing tool. 

lab6: Made in GIS 2. For this lab I created a graphical modeler to process large amounts of data multiple times with different parameters to consider different conditions of wildlife habitats in Maine. 

watershed_lab: Made in GIS 2. In this lab I processed DEMs using a variety of AcrPro tools including sink, flow direction, and flow accumulation to delineate the Saco River Watershed. 

lab5: Made in GIS 1. The purpose of this lab was to show estimations of sea level rise using a DEM. 

income, median income, and employment debate maps: The goal of this lab was to create maps that argued your point for a class debate about the diversity of Maine using U.S. cenus data. I was on the side agruing that Maine is not diverse.
